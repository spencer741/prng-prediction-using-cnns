    "We went with a seed generation method that allowed a way to introduce some minor level of entropy to avoid letting the neural network aimlessly swim through the entropy of a strong seed instead of gaining stochastic insight on the data from the PRNG.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seed generation method we chose derives from the concept of using the system time as an element for seed generation. The specific implementation we chose took inspiration from Microsoft's .NET system.datetime.ticks property. \\cite{msoftdocs} We chose to single out this method due to its documentation and unique simplicity. System time is widely used as a parameter for modern seed generation methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "To put it more trivially: \"a pseudo-random number generator is a deterministic algorithm that, given an initial number (called a seed), generates a sequence of numbers that adequately satisfy statistical randomness tests. Since the algorithm is deterministic, the algorithm will always generate the exact same sequence of numbers if it's initialized with the same seed. That's why system time (something that changes all the time) is usually used as the seed for random number generators.\" \\cite{pseudoquote}\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Microsoft documentation, \"A single tick represents one hundred nanoseconds or one ten-millionth of a second. There are 10,000 ticks in a millisecond, or 10 million ticks in a second. The value of this property represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 12:00:00 midnight, January 1, 0001 in the Gregorian calendar.\" \\cite{msoftdocs}\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a fairly similar Python port, as seen in Figure ~\\ref{fig:Default Seeding Method}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{figure}[H]\n",
    "\\centering\n",
    "\\includegraphics[width=1\\linewidth]{./Images/Ticks.png}\n",
    "\\caption{Default Seeding Method}\n",
    "\\label{fig:Default Seeding Method}\n",
    "\\end{figure}\n",
    "\n",
    "This python port of Microsoft's tick method can be attributed to \"mhawke\" on StackOverflow. \\cite{tickport} The author had some noteworthy comments about this implementation, namely some porting side effects:\n",
    "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "    \\item UTC times are assumed.\n",
    "    \\item The resolution of the DateTime object is given by DateTime.resolution, which is DateTime.timedelta(0, 0, 1) or microsecond resolution (1e-06 seconds). CSharp Ticks are purported to be 1e-07 seconds.\n",
    "\\end{enumerate}\n",
    "\n",
    "For experimental needs, we made additional changes to the implementation:\n",
    "\\begin{enumerate}\n",
    "    \\item Changing start time from January 1, 0001 to January 1, 1970, which effectively reduced the length of the seed for experimental purposes.\n",
    "    \\item Slicing the last 6 digits of the ticks result to acquire more digit variation for frequent invocation.\n",
    "\\end{enumerate}\n",
    "\n",
    "The final modified method allows enough spread between frequently retrieved ticks, where we are assuming reasonable pseudo-unpredictability. This serves as a simplistic but constantly changing control mechanism for being able to seed PRNGs and test experimental outcomes. While not the most cryptographically strong, we needed a way to have some controlled aspect of seed generation to feed into generators of varying cryptographic complexity (to have some baseline of comparison).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original idea was to feed each PRNG different seeds from the same seed generator; however, many PRNG algorithms impose strict seed requirements to pass tests of randomness. Out of the five PRNG methods we implemented, Lagged Fibonacci was the only one that had special seed requirements, so we created a separate seed generator based on the same fundamental ticks generation method, but modified to meet the restrictions. Other PRNGs not implemented in this research that impose seed restrictions include Wichmann-Hill (which accepts three different seeds) and Maximally Periodic Reciprocals (which requires a Sophie Prime), among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask: won't different seed generators introduce flaws or bias in the experiment? Well, it depends on what you are testing. In our case, we are strictly testing the \"complexity\" of the generator itself, so supplying a seed that is not blatantly predictable but also not unpredictable was sufficient. Our goal was to allow the characteristics of the generator to be exposed, for we were cracking the \"complexity\" of the generation algorithm, not the complexity of an arbitrary seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\subsection{PRNG Implementations}\n",
    "For the experiment, we chose five PRNG methods by year of invention. We attempted to choose PRNG methods that displayed popularity in the world of pseudo random number generation while making sure the year of invention was reasonably distributed among the group. Choosing five PRNGs allowed us to focus on implementations, while leaving future research opportunities open for working with other PRNGs that we did not cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chosen PRNGs:\n",
    "\\begin{itemize}\n",
    "  \\item Middle-square method (1946)\n",
    "  \\item Linear congruential generator (1958)\n",
    "  \\item Lagged Fibonacci (1965)\n",
    "  \\item Park-Miller (1988)\n",
    "  \\item Mersenne Twister (1998)\n",
    "\\end{itemize}\n",
    "\n",
    "The call definition of any given PRNG function is as follows:\n",
    "\\begin{lstlisting}\n",
    "PRNGfunc(seed, n) \n",
    "\\end{lstlisting}\n",
    "This is so we can experimentally automate the calling of each PRNG without getting too complex.\n",
    "The given PRNG function should return a list of n generated numbers using the generation method.\n",
    "All other parameters outside of the seed and n are default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the call was PRNG(seed, 10),\n",
    "it might return something like\n",
    "[3,5,10,1,31,17,2,4,6,7]\n",
    "\n",
    "We control parsing the n-length list and handling seeds externally. \n",
    "This plays logically with separation of concerns for our usecase.\n",
    "\n",
    "While python generators can be useful iterating over previously generated iterables,\n",
    "we did not want to clutter our experimental execution code, so we stuck to a classical\n",
    "internal handling of all iterations.\n",

    "Below are short descriptions of each PRNG and any implementation notes made during the developement process.\n",
    "Middle Square:\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "...\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "A note on weakness: For a generator of n-digit numbers, the period can be no longer than 8n. If the middle n digits are all zeroes, \n",
    "the generator then outputs zeroes forever. If the first half of a number in the sequence is zeroes, the subsequent\n",
    "numbers will be decreasing to zero. While these runs of zero are easy to detect, they occur too frequently for this\n",
    "method to be of practical use. The middle-squared method can also get stuck on a number other than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "An already seen list is NOT included in the original middle square method and will not be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Congruential:\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "...\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "The generator is not sensitive to the choice of c, \n",
    "as long as it is relatively prime to the modulus \n",

    "so the value c=1 is commonly chosen.\n",

    "The Lehmer random number generator (named after D. H. Lehmer), \n",

    "\n",
    "While the Lehmer RNG can be viewed as a particular case of the linear congruential generator\n",
    "with c=0, it is a special case that implies certain restrictions and properties.\n",
    "In particular, for the Lehmer RNG, the initial seed must be coprime to the modulus m that is\n",
    "not required for LCGs in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the modulus m and the multiplier a is also more restrictive for the Lehmer RNG.\n",
    "In contrast to LCG, the maximum period of the Lehmer RNG equals m−1 and it is such when m is \n",
    "prime and a is a primitive root modulo m. \n",

After being trained on, ideally thousands of sets, the predictive network will form a better stochastic \"understanding\" of how the PRNG works underneath, thus being able to more accurately predict numbers generated from that PRNG in the future (i.e.,a supervised regression model).
