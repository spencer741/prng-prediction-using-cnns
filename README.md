## S20-team7-project

To start contributing, read the tutorial [here](https://github.com/CSCI4850/S20-team7-project/tree/master/DockerContainer)

### To Do (NOTE, this list is deprecated. Frequent updates in Core code and milestones).
- [X] Modify project proposal to accurately reflect our revised methodology.
- [X] Email all authors of referenced research for code and materials [Check Here](https://github.com/CSCI4850/S20-team7-project/blob/master/Email_Inquiry)
- [X] Enhance group workflow by setting up docker and mapped volume to (local) repo, where changes can easily be made and pushed.[here](https://github.com/CSCI4850/S20-team7-project/tree/master/DockerContainer)
- [X] Create core files and import Keras and toolsets
- [X] Correct (append to) Project Proposal based on feedback with a more detailed plan of action. (For documentation purposes).[here](https://github.com/CSCI4850/S20-team7-project/blob/master/WorkSpace/Project%20Proposal/ProjectProposal.ipynb)
- [X] Find python implementation of the middle-square algorithm and bring it into the repo. (needs to accept a number representing the length of the generated set of PRNs).
- [ ] Set up the predictive network ...

    * The predictive neural net will be a similar model to [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00378.pdf) . . .
    
    > Predictive Model - The predictor is a convolutional neural network implementing the function P(rsplit) :Bn-1→Bnth where rsplit is   the generator’s output vector with the last element removed. The last element is used as the corresponding label for the predictor’s input.
- [ ] Figure out method for logging metrics... i.e., metrics (external of the ProjectCore.ipynb) for historical reference
- [ ] Set up and build out generalized procedure ... Train(string PRNGNAME, ... NN tweakable params ... loggingobject ... etc) ?
